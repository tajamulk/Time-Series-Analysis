# Air Passengers Traffic Forecasting using Time Series

###

## Aim

In this project we are collecting the yearly data of the passenger number of the aeroplane and later predict the future year passenger number. In this project we forecaset the number of global air passenger journeys to increase at an average rate of 4.0% each year over the next 20 years. The number of global air passenger journeys is expected to increase at an average rate of 5.3% each year over the next 5 years.
